    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge regression or L2 regularization is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency. This method performs L2 regularization. Lambda is the penalty term, λ added to the cost function in order to improve model accuracy. \n",

    "    The cost function for ridge regression:\n",
    "    minimize ||y - Xβ||^2 + λ||β||^2 \n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - y is the vector of target variable values (actual value)\n",
    "    - Xβ is predicted value\n",
    "    - X is the matrix of feature values\n",
    "    - β is the vector of coefficients to be estimated\n",
    "    - λ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This penalty term (λ) helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the magnitude of the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the key differences between Ridge Regression and OLS regression is that the coefficient estimates in Ridge Regression are biased but have lower variance than OLS estimates. This means that while the Ridge estimates may not be as accurate as the OLS estimates for a particular sample of data, they are more stable and less sensitive to changes in the data. Another important difference is that Ridge Regression is better suited to situations where there are a large number of correlated predictor variables, as it can handle multicollinearity better than OLS regression."

    "\n",
    "- Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that is proportional to the square of the coefficients, which encourages the model to select a subset of the most important features that contribute the most to the model's predictive power."

    "Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge regression aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates of the regression. The reduction of the standard error in regression estimates significantly increases the reliability of the estimates. In the presence of multicollinearity, Ridge Regression can help by shrinking the estimates of the regression coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing their variance and making them more stable. By introducing a penalty term into the regression equation that is proportional to the square of the coefficients."

For continuous variables, Ridge Regression works by estimating a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. However, for categorical variables, we need to encode them into a format that can be used by Ridge Regression."

    "\n",
    "- The interpretation of the coefficients in Ridge Regression should take into account the strength of the regularization parameter, which controls the degree of regularization. A smaller value of the regularization parameter corresponds to a more flexible model, which can lead to overfitting, while a larger value corresponds to a more constrained model, which can lead to underfitting."

This can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity and overfitting, and provide more stable and reliable predictions.\n",
