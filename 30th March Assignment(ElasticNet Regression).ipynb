    "# Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net is a regularized regression model that combines l1 and l2 penalties, i.e., lasso and ridge regression. regularization helps in overfitting problems of the models. Elastic Net is a regression method that performs variable selection and regularization both simultaneously. In Elastic Net Regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors, as in ordinary least squares regression, but with an additional penalty term that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero. This penalty term is a combination of the L1 penalty of Lasso Regression and the L2 penalty of Ridge Regression. The L1 penality promotes sparisty by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero(feature selection) and L2 penality, on other hand, helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between elastic net regression and other regression models is that it uses both L1 and L2 regularization techniques to overcome the limitations of each method. Elastic net regression is useful when there are many correlated predictors in a model because it can select groups of correlated predictors together instead of selecting only one predictor from each group like lasso does."

    "# Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression can be chosen by tuning the hyperparameters alpha and l1_ratio. The hyperparameter l1_ratio defines how we mix both L1 and L2 regularization. The acceptable range of values for l1_ratio is: 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1 . Alpha is a value between 0 and 1 and is used to weight the contribution of the L1 penalty and one minus the alpha value is used to weight the L2 penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose optimal values of alpha and l1_ratio, we can use cross-validation techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.These techniques can help us find the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the error on a validation set."

    "\n",
    "The advantage of Elastic Net Regression are:\n",
    "- It can handle high-dimensional data sets with a large number of features.\n",
    "- It can handle multicollinearity, which is when some predictors are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "- It can reduce overfitting, which is when the model fits the training data too well, but performs poorly on new or unseen data.\n",
    "- It can perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, while keeping others that are significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage of Elastic Net Regression are:\n",
    "- It requires tuning two hyperparameters: alpha and lambda. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned by the model, but need to be specified by the user. Tuning hyperparameters means finding the optimal values that minimize the error or maximize the performance of the model. Tuning hyperparameters can be time-consuming and computationally expensive, as it requires testing different combinations of values and evaluating their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It may not be suitable for high-dimensional data, where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.Elastic net may also not be suitable for non-linear problems.\n"

    "2. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE): MICE is a commonly used method to handle missing values. In this approach, the missing values are imputed multiple times with plausible values based on observed data. This results in multiple datasets, each with a different set of imputed values.\n",
    "3. Removing missing values: We can remove observations that have missing values. However, this approach may lead to a loss of information and decrease the sample size."
